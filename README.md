# tf_classification
Training, evaluation and testing code for image classification using TensorFlow

## Prepare the Data
* generate tfrecord dataset files for train, val and test splits

## Configuration

### Choose a Network Architecture

## Train & Evaluate

### Warmup a pretrained network
* train last layer
* fixed learning rate
* wait for the validation performance to saturate

### Full Train
* train all layers
* decayed learning rate schedule
* monitor validation and train performance

## Analyze & Iterate

## Test

## Export & Compress

## Serve
